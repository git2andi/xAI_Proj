\section{Introduction}\label{intro}

The core of this project was to understand the key principles of deep learning and to apply them in a practical environment. Through the methodical training and evaluation of various techniques, we progressively deepened our understanding of this complex field. A crucial first step in developing an effective classification model was to thoroughly investigate and understand the dataset at hand. Therefore, our investigation began with an introduction to the well-known datasets MNIST \citep{deng2012mnist} and MedMNIST \citep{medmnistv1}, which served as the building blocks for our study.

The project was structured to take account of the different characteristics of the individual datasets. We started with MNIST, which was chosen due to its wide distribution and the numerous tutorials available, which facilitated our entry into the world of deep learning. With this dataset, we took on the challenge of developing a rudimentary Convolutional Neural Network (SimpleCNN) that was intentionally designed with a limited number of layers. The initial aim of this challenge was not to achieve peak performance, but rather to gain practical experience and understand the basics of the architecture of neural networks and their ability to distinguish between different digits.

As our knowledge increased, we shifted our focus to the more challenging MedMNIST dataset, focusing particularly on the PathMNIST subset. This phase formed the core of our project, in which we focused intensively on experimenting with different pre-trained models. Our investigations extended to testing a wide range of hyperparameters as well as implementing different strategies for data preprocessing and augmentation. The complexity and challenges of the PathMNIST dataset required the use of more advanced techniques and approaches, representing a significant advance over our initial experiments with MNIST.\@
